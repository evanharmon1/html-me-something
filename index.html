                    <p>Bentonville in the Ozarks has some world-class mountain biking trails on top of a pretty nice museum. It's not too expensive and has what people from Kansas can sort of call mountains.</p>

                    <p>Both my parents have family in the Black Hills so we have take a number of family trips overt the years. It's a 12 hour drive from KC, but the mountains (actual) and scenery are worth it.</p>
